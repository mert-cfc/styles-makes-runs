# Styles Makes Runs

Forecasting physical match demands with opponent-aware deep learning.

> This repository will host the code and data accompanying the **Styles Makes Runs** project (working title). It focuses on modeling team playstyle and opponent interactions to predict match-day exposure metrics.

## Status

**Coming soon.** We are finalising:
- Dataset anonymisation and a column-name dictionary.
- Refactoring of feature names in the codebase to align with the anonymised schema.
- Reproducible training/evaluation scripts and environment files.

A tagged release will be published once the anonymised dataset and code are ready.

## What will be included

- `data/` — Sample anonymised dataset + schema/column dictionary (`DATA_DICTIONARY.md`).
- `src/` — Training, inference, and evaluation pipelines.
- `configs/` — YAML configs for experiments (data paths, features, hyperparameters).
- `models/` — Model definitions and saved checkpoints.
